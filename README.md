Figma MCP — Free, No Rate Limits

Open-source Figma MCP server with full read/write access via plugin — no REST API, no rate limits. Turn text into designs and designs into real code. Works with Cursor, Claude, GitHub Copilot, and any MCP-compatible AI tool.

**Highlights**
- No Figma API token required
- No rate limits — free plan friendly
- **Read and Write** live Figma data via plugin bridge
- Supports multiple AI tools simultaneously
- Written in Go, distributed via npm

## Why this exists

Most Figma MCP servers rely on the **Figma REST API**.

That sounds fine… until you hit this:

| Plan | Limit |
|------|-------|
| Starter / View / Collab | **6 tool calls/month** |
| Pro / Org (Dev seat) | 200 tool calls/day |
| Enterprise | 600 tool calls/day |

If you're experimenting with AI tools, you'll burn through that in minutes.

I didn't have enough money to pay for higher limits.
So I built something that **doesn't use the API at all**.

## Installation & Setup

Install via `npx` — no build step required. Watch the setup video or follow the steps below.

[![Watch the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/DjqyU0GKv9k/sddefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/DjqyU0GKv9k)

### Prerequisites

- Figma Desktop
- Node.js 18+ and `npm`/`npx`
- An MCP-compatible AI client such as Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, or GitHub Copilot
- For local plugin development from this repo: `npm install` support in the `plugin/` directory

### 1. Configure your AI tool

**Codex CLI**
```bash
codex mcp add figma-mcp-go -- npx -y @vkhanhqui/figma-mcp-go@latest
```

**Claude Code CLI**
```bash
claude mcp add -s project figma-mcp-go -- npx -y @vkhanhqui/figma-mcp-go@latest
```

**.mcp.json** (Claude and other MCP-compatible tools)
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "figma-mcp-go": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@vkhanhqui/figma-mcp-go@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

**.vscode/mcp.json** (Cursor / VS Code / GitHub Copilot)
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "figma-mcp-go": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@vkhanhqui/figma-mcp-go@latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Install the Figma plugin

You have two options:

**Option A — use the release plugin (fastest)**
1. In Figma Desktop: **Plugins → Development → Import plugin from manifest**
2. Select `manifest.json` from the [plugin.zip](https://github.com/vkhanhqui/figma-mcp-go/releases)
3. Run the plugin inside any Figma file

**Option B — build the plugin locally from this repo**
```bash
cd plugin
npm install
npm run build
```

Then:
1. In Figma Desktop: **Plugins → Development → Import plugin from manifest**
2. Select [`plugin/manifest.json`](plugin/manifest.json)
3. Run the plugin inside any Figma file

The local manifest points to:
- `plugin/dist/code.js`
- `plugin/dist/index.html`

### 3. Start your AI client and verify the connection

1. Restart or reopen your AI client after adding the MCP server.
2. Open any Figma file in Figma Desktop.
3. Run the `Figma MCP Go` plugin.
4. Wait for the badge to change from `Disconnected` to `Connected`.
5. Test with a simple MCP call such as:

```text
get_metadata
```

If the bridge is working, you should get back the current file name, page name, and page IDs.

### 4. Quick local smoke test

If you want to verify the server outside your AI client, run:

```bash
npx -y @vkhanhqui/figma-mcp-go@latest
```

Then open the Figma plugin. It should connect to `ws://localhost:1994/ws`.

This is especially useful after:
- moving to a new machine
- reinstalling macOS
- resetting your AI client config
- debugging a `Disconnected` plugin state

### Troubleshooting

**Plugin stays `Disconnected`**

- Make sure your AI client has actually started the MCP server. Adding config alone is not enough.
- Restart the AI client or open a new session after `mcp add`.
- For a manual check, run `npx -y @vkhanhqui/figma-mcp-go@latest` in a terminal, then reopen the plugin.
- Confirm nothing is blocking local port `1994`.

**Using the local repo plugin**

- Run `cd plugin && npm install && npm run build` before importing the manifest.
- Rebuild after changing files in `plugin/src/`.

**Codex-specific note**

- After `codex mcp add ...`, existing threads may not immediately pick up the new MCP server.
- If Codex does not see the server yet, open a new thread or restart the app/CLI session.
